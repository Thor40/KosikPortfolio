                        Each projectâ€™s aim is to incorporate agile development, allowing the user feedback to explore and expand the direction of the design. I have worked on several previous projects in groups of four using MERN stack, one notably allowing users to request help with tasks or volunteer to help with tasks, like an on-demand delivery app.
